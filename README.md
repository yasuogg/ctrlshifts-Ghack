- **Make sure to make things structured** suppose that I have the task of the hero section, so I'm responsable of
    - Creating my hero section component in the */src/app/components* as mentioned above as my code will be in the Component name folder using the PascalCase naming convention `eg: Hero` and inside it I have all my sub components and partials.
    - Adding my images and static assets in the */public/images* as mentioned above, as I will create a folder under my component name `eg: Hero` and I will put all files inside.
    - Adding my css styling modules if needed in the */src/app/styles* in the styles folder directly using the PascalCase naming convension `eg: Hero.module.css`
    - Adding any sort of custom hooks or assets inside the */src/app/utils* as mentioned above as I will create a folder under my component name `eg: Hero` and I will put all files inside.
- Before start working on your task, **make sure** to create a branch following the convention: `feature/[your_name]/[template]`.e.g: `feature/sohaib/hero`
- **DO NOT PUSH IN THE MAIN DIRECTLY** (push your updates in your branch)
- **Make sure that your changes are up-to-date** (in order to avoid conflicts, perform the command `git pull origin main` before pushing your code in your branch)
